  <h1>When and how was Top 10 Founded?</h1>
  <p>How was Top 10 was founded in 2015, by 1 young man (Will Canino, CEO, Founder). The company was designed and created in Will's Bedroom. Will was just a normal kid, playing with his friends, went to school, had a nice family, etc. Will was bored 1 day and decided he wanted to make a company. Once that company had came to his head, all he did was think about building this brand to the best of his ability. Fast foward 5 or 6 years and Will had thought about designing a company and designing a website. Luckly Will was taking a coding class in school and decided to try and design his own website for the 'Top 10' idea he had a couple years ago. Will quickly went home and got to work, he thought that he was the smartest, and thought he knew everything. Will said to him self 'I don't need google'. 10 minutes into the designing and preping of the site he realised it wasn't as easy as he thought and quickly went to google to find how to do certain things and tags in html. He tried the site and it was really bland and boring, Will went to google and searched "How to make your website look good". Right then and there he found out about CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). Will had no idea of what that was, so he searched and searched all over YouTube and Google to find out how to use CSS. He watched a YouTube video that went for 4 hours and learnt so much from it that he went back to the site and started to design it till it suited his prefernce. Will has created this site from his own bedroom and has done amazing! Top 10 wouldn't have gotten anywhere with out Will's skills and knowledge.
